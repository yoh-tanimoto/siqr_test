# siqr_test
The SIQR model of epidemiology with test and confounding disease.

This is a python code of a modified version of the SIQR model of epidemiology. A fixed number of tests is conducted every day and if one is infected and tested, one goes to Q(uarantined). Tests are conducted on people with symptoms, and there is another confounding disease with the same symptoms with a fixed number of patients.

The original code of the SIR model by Christian Hill is here
